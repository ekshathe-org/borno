# Borno: A forward thinking CSS libary

Borno is inspired from the latest changes in CSS. It's goal is not to ensure maximum compatibility. Any feature that becomes widely available on the latest major browsers (mostly Chrome and Safari), will be used.

It's vanilla CSS. No precompilation is necessary.
